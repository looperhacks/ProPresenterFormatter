# ProPresenterFormatter
Simple tool that fixes the formatting of ProPresenter Songs

This code was written in a rush with hardcoded settings. It currently sets every line to the font settings we use at our church (fonts not included). Maybe some day a better version will come to simply text formatting of songs with propresenter.

This tool only supports files for ProPresenter 6
